These trends reflect a growing recognition of the need for responsible and ethical use of AI in business, and the importance of governance and regulation in achieving this goal.

Challenges in Future AI Governance and Regulation

There are several challenges associated with future AI governance and regulation in business, including:

* Balancing the benefits of AI with the potential risks and harms associated with its use
* Ensuring compliance with regulations can be costly and resource-intensive
